## 🎯 Top Priority Features (High Value, Medium Complexity)

### 1. **Saved Searches / Smart Collections** 🔍

### 2. **Unlinked Mentions Detection** 🔗
**Status**: Listed in plan.md (Reference Panel Enhancements)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Value**: Very High

Find notes that mention the current note's title without explicit `[[links]]`.

**Why this is valuable**:

     "...Project Alpha delivered on time..."
```

### 4. **Section Links** 🔗
**Status**: Listed in plan.md (Section References) - Partially implemented for embeds only
**Complexity**: Medium
**Value**: High

Link to specific sections within notes using `[[note#Section]]` syntax.

**Why this is valuable**:
- You already have section embeds (`![[note#section]]`)
- Natural extension to make sections linkable
- More precise references than full note links

**Features**:
- Click `[[note#section]]` to jump to that section
- Autocomplete suggestions show available sections when typing `#`
- Hover preview shows just that section

- Support both markdown headers (`# Section`) and text-style (`Section:`)
- Graph view option to show section-level connections

**Extends existing**:
- LinkService already parses wiki-style links
- EmbedService already extracts sections
- Just need DocumentLinkProvider to handle `#section` navigation

---

### 5. **Hierarchical Tags** 🏷️
**Status**: Listed in plan.md (Hierarchical Tags)
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Value**: High

Support nested tag hierarchies like `#work/project-alpha/backend`.

**Why this is valuable**:
- Your tag system is already robust (inline + frontmatter)
- Users with many tags need better organization
- Natural categorization (projects, areas, topics)
- Filter by hierarchy levels

**Features**:
