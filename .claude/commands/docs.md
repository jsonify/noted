# Update Documentation

You are being asked to update the project documentation after implementing a new feature or making changes.

## Your Task

Please update the following documentation files as needed:

1. **Website Documentation (`docs/`)**:
   - Update the relevant documentation pages in the `docs/` directory to reflect the new feature or changes
   - If this is a completely new feature, create a new documentation page or section
   - Ensure code examples, usage instructions, and screenshots (if applicable) are included
   - Update the navigation/index if adding new pages

2. **notes.md**:
   - Add the new feature to the appropriate section in `notes.md`
   - Include version number if this is a versioned release
   - Follow the existing format and style
   - Be concise but complete in describing what the feature does

3. **plan.md**:
   - If the feature was listed as planned, mark it as completed with `[x]` and add version number
   - Remove it from the planned section if it's now fully implemented
   - Update any related planned features if implementation differs from original plan

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough**: Documentation should be clear enough for users unfamiliar with the feature
- **Be consistent**: Follow the existing documentation style and formatting
- **Be accurate**: Ensure all code examples work and all descriptions match the actual implementation
- **Cross-reference**: Link between related documentation pages when relevant
- **User-focused**: Write from the user's perspective, not the developer's

## Output

After updating the documentation, provide:
1. A summary of what was documented
2. List of files that were modified or created
3. Any suggestions for additional documentation that might be helpful

---

**Note**: Make sure to read the actual code implementation to ensure documentation accuracy. Don't document based on assumptions.
