## Shipped in v1.4.0 (Core Features)

âœ… **Fully Implemented:**

- Tag indexing service with async operations
- Tags tree view with usage counts
- Filter notes by tags (single or multiple)
- Tag autocomplete when typing `#`
- Sort tags alphabetically or by frequency
- Tag search integration

- Full documentation

## Deferred to Future Releases

The following advanced features are implemented but not yet registered/exposed:

### v1.5.0 - Advanced Tag Management
- [ ] Task 6.8: Register tag management commands
  - `renameTag` - Rename a tag across all notes
  - `mergeTags` - Merge multiple tags into one
  - `deleteTag` - Remove a tag from all notes
  - `exportTags` - Export tags to JSON
- [ ] Task 8.3: Keyboard shortcuts for tag commands
- [ ] Fix remaining test failures (25 tests need mock improvements)

These features are already implemented in `src/commands/tagCommands.ts` and just need to be wired up in package.json and extension.ts when we're ready to expose them to users.
