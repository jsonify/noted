  - validators.ts - Folder name validation
  - dateHelpers.ts - Date formatting utilities
  - folderHelpers.ts - Recursive folder operations
- **src/services/** (4 files, ~400 lines)
  - configService.ts - Configuration management
  - fileSystemService.ts - File operation wrappers
  - noteService.ts - Note operations (search, stats, export)

## Recent Test Infrastructure Improvements

### CI/CD Test Fix (Completed - January 2025)
**Problem**: 21 tests failing in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline due to incomplete VS Code API mocks

**Solution**: Enhanced VS Code mock implementation in `src/test/mocks/vscode.ts`
- Added `Position` class for text document positions
- Added `Range` class with proper TypeScript constructor overloads
- Added `EndOfLine` enum (LF, CRLF)
- Added `CompletionItemKind` enum for autocomplete types
- Added `CompletionItem` class for tag autocomplete
- Added `MarkdownString` class for formatted documentation
- Fixed `EventEmitter.event` to use getter pattern instead of method

**Results**:
- ✅ All 184 tests now passing locally and in CI/CD
- ✅ Tests pass on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ Tests pass on all Node versions (18.x, 20.x)
- ✅ Fixed `setup.ts` cleanup function to not attempt resolving mock modules
- ✅ Test execution time: ~270ms for full suite

**Files Changed**:
- `src/test/mocks/vscode.ts` - Added 7 new VS Code API types
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Fixed cleanup logic for mock modules

### Integration Tests Addition (Completed - January 2025)
**Goal**: Add integration tests for VS Code commands that run in Extension Host environment

**Implementation**: Created 3 comprehensive integration test suites
- `src/test/integration/commands.test.ts` - Note creation, editor, configuration, view, and search commands
- `src/test/integration/noteManagement.test.ts` - Setup, folder management, export, and calendar commands
- `src/test/integration/tagSystem.test.ts` - Tag view, filtering, autocomplete, and search integration

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Note creation commands (openToday, openWithTemplate with all 4 templates)
- ✅ Editor commands (insertTimestamp)
- ✅ Configuration commands (changeFormat, showConfig)
- ✅ View commands (refresh, showStats)
- ✅ Search commands (searchNotes)
- ✅ Setup commands (setupDefaultFolder)
- ✅ Folder management (createFolder)
- ✅ Export commands (exportNotes)
- ✅ Calendar commands (showCalendar)
- ✅ Tag system (refreshTags, sortTagsByName, sortTagsByFrequency, filterByTag)
- ✅ Tag autocomplete (completion provider integration)
- ✅ Tag configuration (tagAutoComplete setting)

**Results**:
- ✅ All integration tests compile and run in VS Code Extension Host
- ✅ Tests verify command execution without errors
- ✅ Tests validate file creation, content structure, and configuration changes
- ✅ Unit tests continue to pass (184 tests)
