- Added `MarkdownString` class for formatted documentation
- Fixed `EventEmitter.event` to use getter pattern instead of method

**Results**:
- âœ… All 184 tests now passing locally and in CI/CD
- âœ… Tests pass on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- âœ… Tests pass on all Node versions (18.x, 20.x)
- âœ… Fixed `setup.ts` cleanup function to not attempt resolving mock modules

**Files Changed**:
- `src/test/mocks/vscode.ts` - Added 7 new VS Code API types
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Fixed cleanup logic for mock modules

### Integration Tests Addition (Completed - January 2025)
**Goal**: Add integration tests for VS Code commands that run in Extension Host environment

- `src/test/integration/noteManagement.test.ts` - Setup, folder management, export, and calendar commands
- `src/test/integration/tagSystem.test.ts` - Tag view, filtering, autocomplete, and search integration

**Test Coverage**:
- âœ… Note creation commands (openToday, openWithTemplate with all 4 templates)
- âœ… Editor commands (insertTimestamp)
- âœ… Configuration commands (changeFormat, showConfig)
- âœ… View commands (refresh, showStats)
- âœ… Search commands (searchNotes)
- âœ… Setup commands (setupDefaultFolder)
- âœ… Folder management (createFolder)
- âœ… Export commands (exportNotes)
- âœ… Calendar commands (showCalendar)
- âœ… Tag system (refreshTags, sortTagsByName, sortTagsByFrequency, filterByTag)
- âœ… Tag autocomplete (completion provider integration)
- âœ… Tag configuration (tagAutoComplete setting)

**Results**:
- âœ… All integration tests compile and run in VS Code Extension Host
- âœ… Tests verify command execution without errors
- âœ… Tests validate file creation, content structure, and configuration changes
- âœ… Unit tests continue to pass (184 tests)
