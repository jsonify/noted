## üìä What Changed in v1.31.8

The PR #43 "streamline error handling and user prompts" made these changes:
- Removed 50+ `console.log` statements (cleaner console)
- Changed silent error catches to inline comments
- Made diagram extension warnings interactive (not just dismissible)
- Added "Create Anyway" and "Don't Ask Again" options
- Fixed DiagramService to use ExtensionContext for state persistence

These changes should NOT break existing functionality - they only improve UX.
