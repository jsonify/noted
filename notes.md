## Architecture Notes

- **Modular architecture** (completed): Code organized into focused modules
  - `src/constants.ts` - Shared constants and templates
  - `src/utils/` - Validation and helper functions
  - `src/services/` - Business logic and file operations
  - `src/providers/` - VS Code tree view providers
  - `src/commands/` - Command handlers
  - `src/calendar/` - Calendar view functionality (helpers and webview)
  - `src/test/` - Comprehensive testing infrastructure
  - `src/extension.ts` - Entry point and command registration (1570 lines, down from 2119)
- **Asynchronous file operations**: All file I/O uses `fs.promises` API with async/await pattern
- **Comprehensive error handling**: All file operations wrapped in try/catch with user-friendly error messages
- **TreeDataProvider pattern**: Standard VS Code tree view implementation with async support
- **Date formatting**: Uses locale-specific formatting (en-US)
- **File name sanitization**: Automatic sanitization for note names from templates

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests (66 tests - all passing)
- **Testing Framework**: Mocha + Chai (v4 for CommonJS compatibility)
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Utilities: validators, date helpers, folder operations (23 tests)
  - Services: file system, templates (29 tests)
  - Providers: tree items (14 tests)
