## Why Noted?

### Built for Developers

Noted understands developer workflows. Keep track of bugs, solutions, API endpoints, meeting decisions, and research - all in plain text files that integrate seamlessly with your version control.

### Stay Organized

Your notes are automatically organized in a `YYYY/MM-MonthName/YYYY-MM-DD.format` structure. Never manually manage folders again.

### Quick Access

With keyboard shortcuts and the quick switcher, your notes are always just a keystroke away. No context switching, no leaving your editor.

### Plain Text First

All notes are stored as plain `.txt` or `.md` files. No proprietary formats, no lock-in. Your notes belong to you.

## Popular Workflows

### Daily Standups
Use templates with dynamic variables to quickly create standardized daily standup notes with automatic date/time insertion.

### Bug Tracking
Tag your bugs with `#bug #critical` and use advanced search to filter by tag, date range, or regex patterns.

### Knowledge Management
Link related notes together with wiki-style links. Embed reusable sections across notes. Build a personal knowledge base that grows with your projects.

### Meeting Minutes
Create structured meeting notes with the built-in template, then link to related notes and tag with project names.
