# About Noted

**Your digital scratch pad for organized note-taking in VS Code**

Noted is a powerful VS Code extension designed for developers who need quick access to daily notes, meeting minutes, research findings, and project ideas - all automatically organized and easily searchable.

## Why Noted?

### Built for Developers

Noted understands developer workflows. Keep track of bugs, solutions, API endpoints, meeting decisions, and research - all in plain text files that integrate seamlessly with your version control.

### Stay Organized

Your notes are automatically organized in a `YYYY/MM-MonthName/YYYY-MM-DD.format` structure. Never manually manage folders again.

### Quick Access

With keyboard shortcuts and the quick switcher, your notes are always just a keystroke away. No context switching, no leaving your editor.

### Plain Text First

All notes are stored as plain `.txt` or `.md` files. No proprietary formats, no lock-in. Your notes belong to you.
