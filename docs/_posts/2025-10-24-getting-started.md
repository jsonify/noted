# How to Get Started with Noted

Get up and running with Noted in just a few minutes and start organizing your workspace notes like a pro.

## Quick Start

1. **Install** from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsonify.noted)
2. **Open** Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)

4. **Start writing!**

## Your First Note

The easiest way to start is to create today's note:

```
Press: Cmd+Shift+N (or Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows/Linux)
```

This opens (or creates) a note for today with the path:
```
