# What is Archiving?

Archive completed or old notes to keep your workspace clean while preserving content for future reference. Hidden storage that maintains organization.

## Quick Start

**Archive a note:**
```
Right-click note → Archive Note
```

**View archived notes:**
```
My Notes
  └── 📦 Archive (5)
      └── [Your archived notes]
```

**Unarchive a note:**
```
Right-click archived note → Unarchive Note
```

## What is Archiving?

Archiving moves notes to a special `.archive/` folder:

```
Notes/
  ├── 2024/
  │   └── 10-October/
  │       └── active-notes.md
  └── .archive/              ← Hidden folder
      └── 2024/
          └── 10-October/
              └── archived-notes.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps active workspace clean
- Preserves note content
- Maintains folder structure
- Easy to browse and restore

## Archive Section

View archived notes in the sidebar:

```
My Notes
  📌 Pinned Notes
  📁 Recent Notes

  📦 Archive (12)
      ├── 2024/
      │   ├── 01-January/ (5 notes)
      │   ├── 02-February/ (3 notes)
      │   └── 10-October/ (4 notes)

  📁 2024
      └── 10-October/
          └── [Active notes]
```

**Archive maintains hierarchy:**
- Year folders
- Month folders
- Custom folders (if any)

## Archiving Notes

### Single Note Archive

Right-click any note:

```
Open Note
Move to Folder

Delete Note
Pin Note
───────────────

[Cancel] [Archive]
```

### Bulk Archive

Archive multiple notes at once:

```
1. Enter select mode
2. Select notes to archive
3. Click "Bulk Archive" button

### What Happens

When you archive a note:

2. **Folder structure preserved** (same year/month/custom path)
3. **Removed from main view** (no longer in active notes)
4. **Appears in Archive section** (still accessible)
5. **Links updated** (if other notes link to it)

## Browsing Archive

### Archive Tree

The Archive section mirrors your main notes structure:

```
📦 Archive (12)
    ├── Projects/
    │   └── Completed/
    │       └── project-alpha.md
    ├── 2024/
    │   ├── 01-January/
    │   │   ├── 2024-01-05.md
    │   │   └── 2024-01-15.md
    │   └── 02-February/
    │       └── sprint-1.md
    └── 2023/
        └── 12-December/
            └── yearly-review.md
```

**Navigate just like active notes:**
- Expand/collapse folders
- Click to open notes
- Right-click for actions

### Opening Archived Notes

Click any archived note to open it:
- Opens in editor (read/write)
- Can edit content
- Can link to it
- Can search it

**Archived ≠ Read-only**

## Unarchiving Notes

### Restore to Active Notes

Right-click archived note:

```
Open Note
Move to Folder
Rename Note
Duplicate Note
Delete Note
───────────────
Unarchive Note  ← Click here
```

**Result:**
- Note moved back to original location
- Appears in active notes
- Removed from Archive section

### Bulk Unarchive

Can't bulk unarchive directly (yet), but you can:

1. Use bulk move from archive
2. Move archived notes to active folders

## Use Cases

### Completed Projects

Archive project notes when done:

```
Project Alpha completed!

Archive:
- project-alpha-spec.md
- project-alpha-tasks.md
- project-alpha-retrospective.md
```

**Result:**
- Active notes stay focused on current work
- Completed projects preserved for reference

### Old Daily Notes

Archive last quarter's daily notes:

```
End of Q3:

Bulk archive:
- All July daily notes
- All August daily notes
- All September daily notes
```

**Result:**
- Recent daily notes easy to find
- Old notes preserved but hidden

### Inactive References

Archive references you rarely use:

```
Archive:
- old-api-docs.md (superseded)
- deprecated-guide.md
- legacy-system-notes.md
```

**Result:**
- Current docs easier to find
- Historical docs still available

### End of Sprint

Archive sprint notes:

```
Sprint 5 complete!

Archive:
- sprint-5-planning.md
- sprint-5-daily.md
- sprint-5-retrospective.md
```

Keep active view focused on current sprint.

### Completed Tasks

Archive finished task notes:

```
Archive:
- bug-123-fixed.md
- feature-auth-shipped.md
- refactor-database-done.md
```

## Archive Strategies

### Time-Based Archiving

Archive by date:

**Quarterly:**
```
Every 3 months:
- Archive notes from 2+ quarters ago
- Keep current and last quarter active
```

**Yearly:**
```
New year:
- Archive all previous year's notes
- Fresh start with current year
```

### Project-Based Archiving

Archive by project lifecycle:

```
Project lifecycle:
1. Planning → Active notes
2. Execution → Active notes
3. Completed → Archive all
4. Maintained → Keep key docs active
```

### Tag-Based Archiving

Archive using tag filters:

```
1. Filter by tag:#completed
2. Select all completed notes
3. Bulk archive
```

Or:

```
1. Filter by tag:#old
2. Review notes
3. Archive what's truly old
```

### Manual Review

Periodic manual review:

```
Monthly review:
1. Browse all notes
2. Archive what you haven't touched
3. Unarchive if you need it later
```

## Archive Organization

### Folder Structure

Archive preserves your organization:

```
Active:
Notes/2024/10-October/meeting.md

Archived:
Notes/.archive/2024/10-October/meeting.md
```

**Same path**, just moved to `.archive/` folder!

### Custom Folders

Custom folders also preserved:

```
Active:
Notes/Projects/Alpha/spec.md

Archived:
Notes/.archive/Projects/Alpha/spec.md
```

### Searching Archive

Archive notes appear in search:

```
Command: Noted: Search Notes
Query: authentication

Results include:
📄 Active notes with "authentication"
📦 Archived notes with "authentication"
```

Archive notes are marked with 📦 icon in results.

## Best Practices

1. **Archive Regularly**: Don't let old notes clutter active workspace
2. **Review Before Archiving**: Make sure you want to archive
3. **Don't Archive References**: Keep frequently-accessed notes active
4. **Use Bulk Operations**: Archive many notes at once efficiently
5. **Don't Delete**: Archive instead of delete (preserves content)

## Archive vs. Delete

### When to Archive

- Completed work (preserve for reference)
- Old daily notes (historical record)
- Inactive projects (might need later)
- Superseded docs (version history)

### When to Delete

- Truly useless notes
- Accidental duplicates
- Test/scratch notes
- Sensitive info to remove

**General rule:** Archive by default, delete only when certain.

## Archive Maintenance

### Review Archive

Periodically review what's archived:

```
1. Browse Archive section
2. Check if anything needs unarchiving
3. Delete truly useless notes
4. Organize if needed
```

### Archive Statistics

See archive size:

```
Command: Noted: Show Statistics

Total notes: 150
Active notes: 100
Archived notes: 50
```

### Cleanup Archive

If archive gets too large:

```
Options:
1. Delete very old notes
2. Export archive to external storage
3. Keep archive, it's not in the way
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Archive Tag

Before archiving, add tag:

```markdown
# Meeting Notes

Content here...

#archived #2024-Q3
```

Makes it easy to find archived notes by tag later.

### Archive Index

Create an archive index note:

```markdown
# Archive Index

## Q3 2024
- [[sprint-5]]
- [[sprint-6]]
- [[sprint-7]]

## Completed Projects
- [[project-alpha]]
- [[project-beta]]
```

Pin this in active notes for easy archive access.

### Quick Archive Access

Keyboard shortcut for archive:

```
File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
Search: "Noted: Archive Note"
Assign: Cmd+Shift+A (or your choice)
```

### Archive Backup

Back up your archive:

```bash
# Archive is in .archive/ folder
cd Notes/.archive
tar -czf archive-backup-2024-10.tar.gz .
```

Or commit to version control.

### Archive Export

Export archived notes:

```
Command: Noted: Export Notes

Options:
- Export active notes only
- Export archived notes only
- Export all notes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Archived Note

Check:
- Archive section is expanded
- Year/month folders are expanded
- Note was actually archived (check main folders too)

Use search to find:
```
Search: filename
```

Shows if in active or archived notes.

### Archive Section Empty

Possible reasons:
- No notes have been archived yet
- Archive folder was deleted/moved
- Extension needs refresh

Try:
```
Command: Noted: Refresh
```

### Unarchive Not Working

Verify:
- Note is actually in archive
- Right-clicking the note (not folder)
- Have permissions to move file

### Archive Count Wrong

If count doesn't match:

```
Command: Noted: Refresh
```

Rebuilds archive index.

## Technical Details

### Archive Location

```
{notesFolder}/.archive/
```

The dot prefix (`.archive`) typically hides the folder in file explorers.

### Folder Structure

Archive mirrors active structure:

```
.archive/
  ├── {year}/
  │   └── {month}/
  │       └── notes
  └── {custom-folders}/
      └── notes
```

### File Operations

Archive is just a move:

```
From: Notes/2024/10-October/note.md
To:   Notes/.archive/2024/10-October/note.md
```

Can be undone with Undo command!
