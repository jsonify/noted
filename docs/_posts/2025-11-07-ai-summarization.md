# What is AI Summarization?

Generate intelligent summaries of your notes using GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities. Analyze single notes, batch process multiple notes, and extract key insights, action items, and keywords from your knowledge base.

## Quick Start

**Single Note:**
```
Right-click any note → Summarize Note
```

**Batch Operations:**
```
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize This Week
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize This Month
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize Custom Date Range
```

## Requirements

- **GitHub Copilot Extension**: Must be installed and active
- **VS Code**: Version 1.80.0 or later
- **Active Copilot Subscription**: GitHub Copilot or Copilot Pro

## Overview

AI Summarization provides three main capabilities:

1. **Single Note Summarization**: Quick summaries of individual notes
2. **Batch Summarization**: Analyze multiple notes across time periods
3. **Smart Caching**: Performance optimization with automatic cache management

All summaries are generated locally using VS Code's Language Model API, ensuring your notes remain private on your machine.

## Single Note Summarization

### From Tree View

1. Right-click any note in the notes tree
2. Select "Summarize Note"
3. Wait for generation (cancellable progress shown)
4. Summary opens in new editor tab

### From Active Editor

1. Open any note in editor
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Type "Noted: Summarize Current Note"
4. Summary generated for active note

### Features

**Cancellable Progress:**
- Click X to cancel during generation
- Immediate feedback on operation status
- Safe to cancel without side effects

**Summary Display:**
```markdown
# Summary: 2025-11-07.md

## Batch Summarization

### Summarize Recent (Last 7 Days)

**Command:** `Noted: Summarize Recent Notes (Last 7 Days)`

Analyzes all notes modified in the past week.

**Use Cases:**
- Weekly review sessions
- Quick catch-up after time away
- Track recent progress

### Summarize This Week

**Command:** `Noted: Summarize This Week`

Analyzes all notes from the current week (Sunday-Saturday).

**Use Cases:**
- End-of-week reviews
- Weekly standup preparation
- Project status updates

### Summarize This Month

**Command:** `Noted: Summarize This Month`

Analyzes all notes from the current calendar month.

**Use Cases:**
- Monthly retrospectives
- Progress reports
- Long-term pattern analysis

### Summarize Custom Range

**Command:** `Noted: Summarize Custom Date Range`

Pick specific start and end dates for analysis.

**Steps:**
1. Run command
2. Enter start date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. Enter end date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
4. Wait for analysis

**Use Cases:**
- Project-specific reviews (e.g., 3-week sprint)
- Event analysis (e.g., conference period)
- Arbitrary time periods

### Batch Processing Modes

**Small Batches (≤10 notes):**
- Single optimized prompt
- Fast processing
- Cohesive narrative summary

**Large Batches (>10 notes):**
- Individual note processing
- Detailed "Processing X of Y" progress
- Combined summary output
- Cancellable at any point

Example progress:
```
Analyzing 25 notes from this month...
Processing 12 of 25: 2025-11-15.md
```

## Smart Caching System

### How It Works

**Automatic Caching:**
- Summaries cached after generation
- File modification timestamp tracked
- Cache key includes summary options

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Automatic when note file changes
- Configuration changes trigger miss
- Manual clearing available

**LRU Eviction:**
- Maximum 100 cached summaries
- Oldest summaries removed first
- Most-used summaries retained

### Benefits

**Performance:**
- Instant retrieval for cached summaries
- No redundant API calls
- Reduced wait times

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Fewer Copilot API requests
- Smart reuse of existing summaries
- Automatic optimization

### Cache Management

**Clear All Cache:**
```
Command: Noted: Clear Summary Cache
```

Removes all cached summaries with confirmation dialog.

**When to Clear:**
- After changing summary settings globally
- Testing different summary options
- Troubleshooting issues

- No third-party services
- No data storage outside VS Code

**API Usage:**
- VS Code Language Model API
- GitHub Copilot backend
- Same security as Copilot chat
- Covered by GitHub privacy policy

**Cache Storage:**
- Stored in VS Code global state
- Local to your machine
- Not synced or shared
- Cleared on extension uninstall

### Best Practices

**Sensitive Information:**
- Review summaries before sharing
- Don't include credentials in notes
- Be mindful of confidential data
- Use judgment when summarizing

**Opt-Out:**
```json
{
  "noted.ai.enabled": false
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "GitHub Copilot is not available"

**Cause:** Copilot extension missing or inactive

**Solutions:**
1. Install GitHub Copilot extension
2. Sign in to GitHub account
3. Verify active Copilot subscription
4. Restart VS Code

### Slow Summary Generation

**Cause:** Large notes or slow API response

**Solutions:**
- Wait patiently (normal for large notes)
- Check internet connection
- Try again during off-peak hours
- Cancel and retry if stalled

### "AI summarization is disabled"

**Cause:** Feature disabled in settings

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "noted.ai.enabled": true
}
```

### Unexpected Summary Content

**Cause:** AI interpretation varies

**Solutions:**
- Try different format (paragraph vs. structured)
- Adjust length setting
- Regenerate (results may vary)
- Clear cache and retry

### Cache Not Working

**Cause:** Cache disabled or cleared

**Solutions:**
1. Verify cache enabled:
   ```json
   {
     "noted.ai.cacheEnabled": true
   }
   ```
2. Check cache stats in output
3. Summaries cache after first generation

## Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Notes for Better Summaries

**Clear Structure:**
- Use headers for sections
- Organize thoughts logically
- Separate topics clearly

**Explicit Action Items:**
- Use TODO, ACTION, or checkboxes
- Be specific about next steps

### Optimizing Performance

**Cache Utilization:**
- Don't change settings frequently
- Let cache build over time
- Clear only when needed

**Batch Operations:**
- Prefer specific time ranges
- Use week/month for regular reviews
- Custom ranges for projects

**Progress Management:**
- Cancel if wrong operation selected
