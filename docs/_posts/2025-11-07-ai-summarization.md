# What is AI Summarization?

Generate intelligent summaries of your notes using GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities. Analyze single notes, batch process multiple notes, and extract key insights, action items, and keywords from your knowledge base.

## Quick Start

**Summarize Selection (v2.0.1):**
```
Select text → Right-click → Summarize Selection
```

**Create Action Items (v2.0.2):**
```
Select text → Right-click → Create Action Items → As Checkboxes / As Bullets
```

**Single Note:**
```
Right-click any note → Summarize Note
```

**Batch Operations:**
```
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize This Week
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize This Month
Command Palette → Noted: Summarize Custom Date Range
```

## Requirements

- **GitHub Copilot Extension**: Must be installed and active
- **VS Code**: Version 1.80.0 or later
- **Active Copilot Subscription**: GitHub Copilot or Copilot Pro

## Overview

AI Summarization provides five main capabilities:

1. **Summarize Selection** ⭐ NEW (v2.0.1): Instant summaries of selected text
2. **Create Action Items** ⭐ NEW (v2.0.2): Extract tasks from selected text
3. **Single Note Summarization**: Quick summaries of individual notes
4. **Batch Summarization**: Analyze multiple notes across time periods
5. **Smart Caching**: Performance optimization with automatic cache management

All summaries are generated locally using VS Code's Language Model API, ensuring your notes remain private on your machine.

## Summarize Selection (v2.0.1)

Instantly summarize any selected text and insert the summary directly below your selection.

### How to Use

1. Select any text in a note
2. Right-click to open context menu
3. Click "Summarize Selection"
4. AI generates summary and inserts it below your selection

### Features

- **Inline Results**: Summary inserted directly below selection with a header
- **Cancellable**: Click X during generation to cancel
- **Smart Formatting**: Uses markdown formatting for readability
- **Context Preservation**: Original selection remains intact

### Output Format

```markdown
[Your selected text here]

## Summary

[AI-generated summary of the selected text]
```

### Use Cases

- Summarize long meeting notes or discussions
- Create quick TL;DR for email threads pasted into notes
- Condense research findings or documentation
- Get the gist of copied content before deciding to keep it

## Create Action Items (v2.0.2)

Extract actionable tasks from any selected text with AI analysis.

### How to Use

1. Select text containing tasks, discussions, or notes
2. Right-click to open context menu
3. Hover over "Create Action Items"
4. Choose format:
   - **As Checkboxes**: Creates `- [ ] Task description`
   - **As Bullets**: Creates `- Task description`

### Features

- **Smart Extraction**: AI identifies actionable items from conversational text
- **Deadline Detection**: Preserves mentioned dates and deadlines
- **Assignee Tracking**: Includes mentioned people in parentheses
- **Priority Markers**: Identifies and marks urgent items
- **Grouped Output**: Related items organized together

### Output Format

**Checkboxes (for task tracking):**
```markdown
## Action Items

- [ ] Review the authentication PR (John)
- [ ] Deploy API updates by Friday
- [ ] [URGENT] Fix production bug in payment service
- [ ] Update documentation for new endpoints
```

**Bullets (for simple lists):**
```markdown
## Action Items

- Review the authentication PR (John)
- Deploy API updates by Friday
- [URGENT] Fix production bug in payment service
- Update documentation for new endpoints
```

### Use Cases

- Extract tasks from meeting notes
- Convert brainstorm sessions into actionable lists
- Parse email threads for follow-up items
- Turn project discussions into task lists
- Create checklists from requirements documents

### When No Items Found

If the AI cannot identify actionable items in your selection, you'll see a notification:
```
No action items identified
```

This happens when the text is purely informational without specific tasks.

## Single Note Summarization

### From Tree View

1. Right-click any note in the notes tree
2. Select "Summarize Note"
3. Wait for generation (cancellable progress shown)
4. Summary opens in new editor tab

### From Active Editor

1. Open any note in editor
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Type "Noted: Summarize Current Note"
4. Summary generated for active note

### Features

**Cancellable Progress:**
- Click X to cancel during generation
- Immediate feedback on operation status
- Safe to cancel without side effects

**Summary Display:**
```markdown
# Summary: 2025-11-07.md

- Most-used summaries retained

### Benefits

**Performance:**
- Instant retrieval for cached summaries
- No redundant API calls
- Reduced wait times

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Fewer Copilot API requests
- Smart reuse of existing summaries
- Automatic optimization

### Cache Management

**Clear All Cache:**
```
Command: Noted: Clear Summary Cache
```

Removes all cached summaries with confirmation dialog.

**When to Clear:**

- Review summaries before sharing
- Don't include credentials in notes
- Be mindful of confidential data
- Use judgment when summarizing

**Opt-Out:**
```json
{
  "noted.ai.enabled": false
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "GitHub Copilot is not available"

**Cause:** Copilot extension missing or inactive

**Solutions:**
1. Install GitHub Copilot extension
2. Sign in to GitHub account
3. Verify active Copilot subscription
4. Restart VS Code

### Slow Summary Generation

**Cause:** Large notes or slow API response

**Solutions:**
- Wait patiently (normal for large notes)
- Check internet connection
- Try again during off-peak hours
- Cancel and retry if stalled

### "AI summarization is disabled"

**Cause:** Feature disabled in settings

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "noted.ai.enabled": true
}
```

### Unexpected Summary Content

**Cause:** AI interpretation varies

**Solutions:**
- Try different format (paragraph vs. structured)
- Adjust length setting
- Regenerate (results may vary)
- Clear cache and retry

### Cache Not Working

**Cause:** Cache disabled or cleared

**Solutions:**
1. Verify cache enabled:
   ```json
   {
     "noted.ai.cacheEnabled": true
   }
   ```
2. Check cache stats in output
3. Summaries cache after first generation

## Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Notes for Better Summaries

**Clear Structure:**
- Use headers for sections
- Organize thoughts logically
- Separate topics clearly

**Explicit Action Items:**
- Use TODO, ACTION, or checkboxes
- Be specific about next steps
- Include context

**Descriptive Content:**
- Avoid abbreviations
- Write complete thoughts
- Include reasoning

### Optimizing Performance

**Cache Utilization:**
- Don't change settings frequently
- Let cache build over time
- Clear only when needed

**Batch Operations:**
- Prefer specific time ranges
- Use week/month for regular reviews
- Custom ranges for projects

**Progress Management:**
- Cancel if wrong operation selected
- Wait for progress indicators
- Don't interrupt final processing

### Summary Management

**Save Important Summaries:**
- Copy to permanent notes
- Use as meeting agendas
- Archive for later reference

**Iterate on Settings:**
- Try different lengths
- Test format options
- Adjust to preferences
