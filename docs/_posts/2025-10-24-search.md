# What is Smart Search?

AI-powered semantic search that understands context and meaning. Ask questions in natural language and find notes by concept, not just keywords. Powered by GitHub Copilot.

## Quick Start

```
Command: Noted: Search Notes
Type: What bugs did I fix last week?
Press Enter
```

**Tip**: Set up a custom keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Cmd+Shift+F`) for faster access.

## Natural Language Queries

### Ask Questions

Search using plain English questions:

```
Query: What did I work on yesterday?
Result: AI analyzes all notes from yesterday and ranks by relevance
```

```
Query: What bugs did I fix last week?
Result: Finds bug-related notes from the past 7 days
```

```
Query: notes about authentication issues
Result: Finds notes about login, credentials, auth errors, etc.
```

### Semantic Understanding

Find notes by **meaning**, not just exact keywords:

```
Query: authentication problems
Finds: Notes about "login errors", "credential issues", "sign-in failures"
```

```
Query: performance optimization
Finds: Notes about "speed improvements", "making code faster", "reducing latency"
```

```
Query: database connection issues
Finds: Notes about "DB connectivity", "SQL server errors", "connection pooling"
```

**How it works**: GitHub Copilot analyzes note content and understands conceptual relationships between terms.

## Search Strategies

Smart Search automatically chooses the best approach:

### 🔍 Keyword Search (Fast)

For simple, specific queries:

```
Query: database
Strategy: Keyword
Result: All notes containing "database" (instant)
```

**When used:**
- Short queries (1-2 words)
- Exact term searches
- Simple lookups

### ✨ Semantic Search (AI-Powered)

For questions and conceptual queries:

```
Query: How do I fix authentication errors?
Strategy: Semantic
Result: AI-ranked notes about auth troubleshooting
```

**When used:**
- Natural language questions
- Queries with question words (what, how, why)
- Conceptual searches
- Phrases like "about", "related to", "issues with"

### 🔗 Hybrid Search (Best of Both)

For complex multi-word queries:

```
Query: react performance issues from last month
Strategy: Hybrid
Result: Keyword pre-filter → AI re-ranking
```

**How it works:**
1. Fast keyword search to get candidates (top 20)
2. AI analyzes candidates for semantic relevance
3. Returns best matches with high accuracy

**When used:**
- Multi-word queries (3+ words)
- Specific topics with context
- Best balance of speed and accuracy

## Relevance Scoring

Every result shows a relevance score and match type:

```
✨ 2025-10-23-auth-fix.md     95% · Semantic
   Fixed authentication bug causing 401 errors...

🔍 2025-10-15-login-issue.md  87% · Keyword
   PROBLEM: User login fails with credential error...

🔗 2025-10-10-security.md     82% · Hybrid
   Reviewed authentication flow and identified...
```

**Icons:**
- ✨ **Semantic**: AI-determined relevance
- 🔍 **Keyword**: Traditional text matching
- 🔗 **Hybrid**: Combined approach

**Score**: 0-100% confidence that the note is relevant to your query

## Advanced Filters

Combine AI search with powerful filters:

### Tag Filters

Filter by hashtags inline:

```
Query: #react performance issues
Result: Only notes tagged #react about performance
```

```
Query: tag:backend authentication
Result: Backend notes about authentication
```

### Date Filters (Natural Language)

Use natural language dates:

```
Query: bugs from last week
Result: Bug notes from the past 7 days
```

```
Query: from:yesterday meeting notes
Result: Meeting notes from yesterday onward
```

```
Query: from:last month to:today project updates
Result: Project notes from last 30 days
```

**Supported date expressions:**
- `yesterday`, `today`
- `last week`, `last month`, `last year`
- `last 7 days`, `last 30 days`
- `this week`, `this month`, `this year`
- `from:YYYY-MM-DD`, `to:YYYY-MM-DD` (specific dates)

### Format Filters

Filter by file format:

```
Query: format:md notes about API
Result: Only markdown files about APIs
```

```
Query: format:txt meeting notes
Result: Only .txt files with meeting notes
```

### Template Filters

Filter by note template:

```
Query: template:meeting from:last week
Result: Meeting template notes from last week
```

## Combining Filters

Mix AI search with multiple filters:

```
Query: #bug authentication from:last week
```

This finds:
- Notes tagged `#bug`
- About authentication (semantic)
- From the past 7 days

**Filter order doesn't matter** - use any order you prefer.

## Quick Switcher

Fast access to recent notes without search:

```
Press: Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
Command: Noted: Quick Switcher
```

**Shows:**
- 20 most recently modified notes
- Modification dates
- Quick preview
- Instant navigation

**Best for**: Switching between active notes you were just editing

## Configuration

Customize search behavior in settings:

### Enable/Disable Semantic Search

```json
"noted.search.enableSemantic": true
```

**Default**: Enabled (falls back to keyword if Copilot unavailable)

### Max Results

```json
"noted.search.maxResults": 20
```

**Default**: 20 results (1-100)

### Minimum Relevance Score

```json
"noted.search.minRelevanceScore": 0.5
```

**Default**: 0.5 (50% confidence minimum)
**Range**: 0.0-1.0

### AI Analysis Settings

```json
"noted.search.maxCandidates": 20,
"noted.search.hybridCandidates": 20,
"noted.search.chunkSize": 3000
```

- `maxCandidates`: Max notes to analyze with AI (5-50)
- `hybridCandidates`: Top keyword results to re-rank (5-50)
- `chunkSize`: Characters per note sent to AI (500-10000)

### Fuzzy Matching

```json
"noted.search.enableFuzzyMatch": false
```

**Default**: Disabled
**When enabled**: Tolerates typos in keyword searches

## Search Examples

### Bug Tracking

Find bugs you worked on:

```
Query: What bugs did I fix this month?
```

Find critical issues:

```
Query: #bug #critical authentication
```

### Project Management

Project updates:

```
Query: project alpha updates from last week
```

Open action items:

```
Query: #project-alpha TODO
```

### Meeting Notes

Recent team meetings:

```
Query: #meeting #team from:last month
```

Meetings about specific topic:

```
Query: What did we discuss about the API redesign?
```

### Learning Log

Recent learning:

```
Query: What did I learn about React last week?
```

Topic search:

```
Query: notes about GraphQL and performance
```

### Code Review

```

Security reviews:

```
Query: #review #security authentication
```

## Use Cases

### Find Related Notes

Even when you don't remember exact terms:

```
I wrote: "credential validation errors"
You search: authentication problems
Result: ✅ Found! (semantic matching)
```

### Ask Questions

Get answers from your notes:

```
Query: How did I solve the database timeout issue?
Result: Notes ranked by relevance to that problem
```

### Time-Based Searches

Natural language dates:

```
Query: meeting notes from last Tuesday
Query: bugs I fixed yesterday
Query: what I worked on this week
```

### Conceptual Searches

Find notes by topic, not keywords:

```
Query: improving application speed
Finds: performance, optimization, caching, lazy loading
```

## Requirements

**GitHub Copilot**: Semantic search requires GitHub Copilot extension

**Fallback**: If Copilot is unavailable, automatically falls back to keyword search

**No Copilot?**
- Keyword search still works
- All filters still work
- Only semantic AI features unavailable

## Best Practices

1. **Ask Natural Questions**: "What did I work on yesterday?" works better than "work yesterday"
2. **Be Conversational**: Write how you'd ask a person
3. **Combine with Filters**: Add `#tags` and date filters to narrow results
4. **Check Relevance Scores**: 80%+ are usually very relevant
5. **Try Different Phrasings**: If results aren't good, rephrase your question

## Tips for Better Results

### Descriptive Queries

❌ **Too vague**: `auth`
✅ **Better**: `authentication issues I encountered`
✅ **Best**: `What authentication problems did I fix last week?`

### Use Context

❌ **Generic**: `error`
✅ **Better**: `database connection errors`
✅ **Best**: `how to fix database timeout errors`

### Combine Strategies

Start broad, then filter:

```
Step 1: What bugs did I fix?
Step 2: Add filter: #backend
Step 3: Add date: from:last month
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Copilot not available"

**Solution**: Install and sign in to GitHub Copilot extension

**Workaround**: Search still works (keyword mode)

### Results not relevant

Try:
- Rephrase your query more specifically
- Add tag filters to narrow scope
- Use date filters to limit time range
- Check your spelling

### Slow search

For large note collections:
- Use tag filters first
- Add date filters
- Lower `maxCandidates` setting
- AI analysis takes longer with more notes

### Too few results

- Lower `minRelevanceScore` to 0.3
- Remove restrictive filters
- Use broader search terms
- Check that notes exist in that time range
