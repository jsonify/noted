# Connections Panel

The Connections panel provides an always-visible sidebar view of all note relationships, showing both incoming backlinks and outgoing links with rich context and easy navigation.

## Overview

The Connections panel is a dedicated sidebar view that automatically displays all connections for the currently active note. It updates in real-time as you switch between notes, giving you constant visibility into your knowledge network without running any commands.

## Features

### Always-Visible Sidebar

The Connections panel appears in the Noted sidebar activity bar, below the main notes tree. It's always visible and updates automatically - no commands to run, no panels to toggle.

**Location:** Noted Sidebar ‚Üí Connections view

### Bidirectional Display

The panel shows two separate sections with real-time counts:

- **Outgoing Links (N)**: Notes that the current note links to
- **Backlinks (N)**: Notes that link to the current note

This bidirectional view gives you a complete picture of how the current note fits into your knowledge base.

### Rich Context

Each connection displays:

- **Note name**: The connected note's filename
- **Line number**: Where the connection appears
- **Context snippet**: The actual line containing the link
- **Display text**: Custom text from `[[link|Display Text]]` syntax (if used)

**Example connection item:**
```
üìÑ meeting-notes                    "project update" (line 23)
```

Hover over any connection to see the full tooltip with:
- Complete context (lines before/after)
- Source file path
- Metadata about the connection

### Quick Navigation

**Open Connected Note:**
- Click any connection to open the target note
- The note opens in the current editor

**Jump to Source Line:**
- Right-click a connection
- Select "Open Connection Source"
- Opens the source note and jumps to the exact line containing the link
- Useful for seeing the full context of incoming backlinks

### Grouped Connections

When multiple connections exist to the same note, they're intelligently grouped:

```
üìÑ project-plan          (3 connections)
  ‚îú‚îÄ line 12: First reference
  ‚îú‚îÄ line 45: Second reference
  ‚îî‚îÄ line 78: Third reference
```

This shows connection strength and helps you understand how heavily notes reference each other.

### Real-Time Updates

The Connections panel automatically refreshes when:

- You switch to a different note
- You save a document (links may have changed)
- You create or delete a note
- The backlinks index is rebuilt

**No manual refresh needed** - the panel stays synchronized with your workspace.

### Auto-Backlinks Sections

Noted can automatically append a backlinks section to your notes, providing a permanent record of all incoming references directly in the note file.

**How it works:**
- When enabled, notes automatically get a `## Backlinks` section at the end
- The section lists all notes that link to the current note
- Each backlink shows the source note's tags from frontmatter
- Updates automatically whenever links are created or removed

**Example backlinks section:**
```markdown
---
## Backlinks
- [[project-notes]] - #important #project
- [[meeting-2025-01-15]] - #meeting #team
- [[research-ideas]]
```

**Configuration:**
- **Enabled by default** - backlinks sections are added automatically
- **Toggle in settings**: `noted.autoBacklinks` (true/false)
- **Manual refresh**: Run "Noted: Rebuild Backlinks Index"
- **Clear all**: Run "Noted: Clear All Backlinks Sections"

**Format details:**
- Each backlink shows: `- [[note-name]] - #tag1 #tag2`
- Tags are extracted from the source note's frontmatter
- Separator line (`---`) clearly marks auto-generated content
- Only notes with actual backlinks get the section

**Benefits:**
- Permanent record of references (survives outside VS Code)
- See tags from referencing notes at a glance
- Portable - works with any markdown viewer
- Complements the Connections panel (UI vs. file-based)

**Disabling:**
1. Open Settings (`Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "noted.autoBacklinks"
3. Uncheck to disable
4. Run "Noted: Clear All Backlinks Sections" to remove existing sections

## Using the Connections Panel

### Basic Workflow

1. **Open a note** in your editor
2. **Check the Connections panel** to see all relationships
3. **Click a connection** to navigate to a related note
4. **Use "Open Connection Source"** to see where backlinks originated

### Finding Related Information

The Connections panel helps you discover related content:

**Exploring Outgoing Links:**
- See all notes you've referenced in the current note
- Follow links to dive deeper into topics
- Identify notes that need linking

**Exploring Backlinks:**
- See which notes reference the current note
- Discover unexpected connections
- Understand how others use this note

### Building Your Knowledge Network

**Create Bidirectional Links:**
```
// In note-a.txt
See [[note-b]] for more details

// Check Connections panel in note-b.txt
// You'll see note-a in the Backlinks section
// Click to go back and create reverse link if needed
```

**Track Reference Frequency:**
- Look for notes with high connection counts
- These are likely important hub notes
- Consider adding more detail or breaking into subtopics

**Find Orphaned Content:**
- Notes with no connections appear in Graph View as isolated
- Use Connections panel to add relevant links
- Build a more interconnected knowledge base

## Commands

### Refresh Connections

Manually refresh the connections panel and rebuild the backlinks index:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run "Noted: Refresh Connections"
3. Backlinks index rebuilds in background

**When to use:**
- After bulk operations (move, rename, delete)
- If connections seem out of sync
- After external file changes

### Open Connection

Navigate to a connected note:

- **Automatic**: Click any connection in the panel
- **Manual**: Right-click ‚Üí "Open Connection"

Opens the target note in your editor.

### Open Connection Source

Jump to the exact line where a link appears:

- Right-click any connection
- Select "Open Connection Source"
- Editor opens source note at the specific line
- Line is highlighted and centered

**Especially useful for:**
- Understanding context of backlinks
- Seeing how others reference your notes
- Quick navigation to specific mentions

## Empty State

When no note is active or the current file isn't a note:

```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  No active note
    Open a note to see its connections
```

The panel shows an informative message and waits for you to open a note.

## Integration with Other Features

- **Background refresh**: Doesn't block editing

**For very large workspaces (1000+ notes):**
- Initial index build may take a few seconds
- Subsequent updates are instant
- Manual refresh available if needed

## Keyboard-Free Navigation

The Connections panel enables mouse-only workflows:

1. Click note in main tree
2. See connections in panel
3. Click connection to navigate
4. Repeat to explore knowledge network

No keyboard shortcuts needed for basic navigation.

3. Do target notes exist?
4. Try "Refresh Connections" command

### Wrong Connection Count

**Fix:**
1. Save all open files
2. Run "Noted: Refresh Connections"
3. Wait for index rebuild (automatic)

### Missing Backlinks

**Possible causes:**
- Linking note not saved yet
- Broken link syntax
- Target note name doesn't match

**Solution:**
- Open linking note and verify syntax
- Use Link Diagnostics to find issues
- Run "Refresh Connections"

### Slow Updates

**If panel feels sluggish:**
- Index may be rebuilding
- Large workspace (1000+ notes) may take seconds
- Wait for background process to complete
