## Overview

Pinned Notes (also called Favorites) allow you to mark important or frequently accessed notes for quick access. Pinned notes appear in a dedicated section at the top of the My Notes view, so they're always just one click away‚Äîno matter where they're stored in your folder structure.

## Best Practices

### How Many to Pin?

**Recommended**: 5-10 notes

- Too few: Not leveraging the feature
- Too many: Defeats the purpose of quick access
- Sweet spot: 5-10 notes you truly access frequently

### Keep Pins Current

Regularly review and update your pinned notes:

- **Weekly**: Unpin notes you haven't accessed
- **Monthly**: Review all pinned notes for relevance
- **After projects**: Unpin completed project notes

### Pin vs. Archive

**Pin notes that are**:
- Currently active
- Frequently accessed
- High priority
- Reference material

**Archive notes that are**:
- Completed work
- No longer relevant
- Infrequently accessed
- Historical reference

### Organizing Pinned Notes

Since pins appear in order they were pinned:

- Pin most important notes last (they appear at bottom, closer to Recent Notes)
- Or unpin all and re-pin in your preferred order
- Consider naming conventions to keep related pins grouped alphabetically

## Troubleshooting

### Pinned note doesn't appear in section

**Cause**: Note might have been deleted

**Solution**:
- Check if note still exists in its original folder
- Check Archive section
- If deleted, pin is automatically removed

### Can't find pin option in context menu

**Cause**: Context menu not showing for note items

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're right-clicking a note (not a folder)
- Ensure you're right-clicking in the tree view
- Try clicking the note first, then right-clicking

### Pinned notes disappeared after restart

**Cause**: Workspace storage might be corrupted

**Solution**:
- Re-pin the notes you need
- Check VS Code workspace settings for corruption
- Ensure you're in the same workspace

### Too many pinned notes, can't find what I need

**Solution**: Review and unpin less frequently accessed notes

**Best Practice**: Keep pins to 5-10 most important notes

### Pinned note still shows in folder

**Expected Behavior**: Pinned notes appear in BOTH locations:
- In the Pinned Notes section (for quick access)
- In their original folder location (for context)

This is intentional‚Äîunpinning removes it only from the Pinned Notes section.
