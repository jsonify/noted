# Note Embeds

Embed content from other notes directly into your current note, creating a seamless way to reference and include information without duplicating content.

## Overview

Note embeds allow you to include the entire content of a note or specific sections from other notes inline. Unlike links which require clicking to view, embeds show the content directly in your editor.

## Basic Embed Syntax

### Embed Entire Notes

Embed the full content of another note using the `![[note-name]]` syntax:

```
Meeting Agenda
==================================================

![[standard-meeting-template]]

## Today's Topics
- Project updates
- Q4 planning
```

The exclamation mark `!` before the brackets converts a link into an embed. When you save or view the note, the content of `standard-meeting-template` appears inline.

### Visual Indicators

Embeds show a üìÑ icon next to them to indicate they're actively embedding content:

```
![[template]] üìÑ
```

Hover over the icon to see a preview of the embedded content.

## Embed Specific Sections (v1.17.0)

### Section Syntax

Embed only a specific section of a note using the hash `#` symbol:

```
![[meeting-notes-2025-10-19#Action Items]]
![[design-doc#Architecture Overview]]
![[research-notes#Key Findings]]
```

**Syntax:** `![[note-name#Section Title]]`

### How Sections Are Identified

Noted recognizes two types of section headings:

#### Markdown Headings

Any markdown heading from H1 to H6:

```markdown
# Main Heading
## Sub Heading
### Sub-Sub Heading
```

#### Text-Style Headings

Headings followed by a colon:

```
Problem:
This is the problem statement.

Solution:
This is the solution.
```

### Section Matching

Section matching is **case-insensitive** and matches the heading text exactly:

```
![[notes#action items]]     ‚Üí Matches "Action Items"
![[notes#ACTION ITEMS]]     ‚Üí Matches "Action Items"
![[notes#Action Items]]     ‚Üí Matches "Action Items"
```

### Nested Sections

When you embed a section, all nested subsections are included:

**Source note `design-doc.md`:**
```markdown
## Architecture

### Frontend
React with TypeScript

### Backend
Node.js with Express

## Deployment

### Production
AWS infrastructure
```

**Embed:** `![[design-doc#Architecture]]`

**Result includes:**
- The "Architecture" heading
- The "Frontend" subsection and its content
- The "Backend" subsection and its content
- Stops at "Deployment" (same level heading)

## Embed with Display Text

Customize how the embed appears in your note:

```
![[template|Standard Meeting Format]]
![[research-notes#Findings|Key Research Results]]
```

**Syntax:** `![[note-name#section|Custom Display Text]]`

The display text appears in place of the embed syntax when rendered, but the actual embedded content comes from the target note/section.

## Hover Previews

### Preview Embedded Content

Hover over any embed to see:
- The note name and section being embedded
- Preview of the content (first 15 lines)
- Available sections in the target note
- Link to open the source note

**Example hover preview:**

```
üìÑ Embedding: design-doc ‚Üí Architecture

---
## Architecture

### Frontend
React with TypeScript and modern hooks
...

---

Available sections:
- Main Heading
- Architecture
- Deployment
- Testing Strategy

[Open note ‚Üí]
```

### Section Not Found

If you reference a non-existent section, you'll see a warning:

```
![[notes#Nonexistent Section]] ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**Hover shows:**
- Warning that section wasn't found
- List of available sections
- Suggestion to update the section name

## Inline Decorations

### Visual Feedback

Embeds show real-time visual feedback in the editor:

- **üìÑ Green icon**: Valid embed, content found
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow icon**: Note found, but section not found
- **‚ùå Red icon**: Note not found or error loading

### Content Preview

Hover over the decoration icon to see:
- Note name and section (if specified)
- First 20 lines of embedded content
- Truncated lines shown with `‚Ä¶` indicator
- Total content may be limited for performance

## Best Practices

### When to Use Embeds vs Links

**Use Embeds When:**
- You want content visible without clicking
- Creating aggregation/dashboard notes
- Building composite documents from reusable sections
- Content needs to be inline for context

**Use Links When:**
- Content is supplementary/optional
- You want to keep notes focused and concise
- Avoiding too much visual clutter
- Linking to entire documents for reference

### Organizing for Embeds

**Create Reusable Sections:**

```markdown
# Templates

## Meeting Agenda Template

1. Review action items from last meeting
2. New business
3. Open discussion
4. Action items

## Standard Footer

---
Next Steps: Schedule follow-up
Questions: Contact team lead
```

Then embed specific sections:
```
![[templates#Meeting Agenda Template]]
![[templates#Standard Footer]]
```

**Modular Documentation:**

Break large documents into logical sections that can be embedded independently:

```
api-guide.md
  # Authentication
  # Endpoints
  # Error Codes
  # Rate Limiting

security-policy.md
  # Password Requirements
  # 2FA Setup
  # API Key Management
```

### Performance Considerations

**Limit Embed Depth:**
- Avoid embedding notes that themselves contain many embeds
- Deep nesting can slow down rendering
- Keep embed chains to 2-3 levels maximum

**Section Size:**
- Embedding specific sections is faster than full notes
- Large embedded notes may take longer to render
- Consider breaking very large notes into smaller ones

**Refresh Behavior:**
- Embeds update when you save the source note
- Embeds update when you edit the target note
- Changes appear in real-time as you type

## Troubleshooting

### Embed Not Showing Content

**Check:**
1. Is the note name spelled correctly?
2. Does the note exist in your workspace?
3. Is the section name exact (case-insensitive)?
4. Check the hover preview for error details

### Section Not Found

**Solutions:**
1. Hover over the embed to see available sections
2. Verify the heading exists in the target note
3. Check heading syntax (markdown `#` or text `:` format)
4. Ensure section name matches exactly (spaces, punctuation)

### Embed Shows Old Content

**Refresh:**
1. Save both the target note and embedding note
2. VS Code should auto-refresh decorations
3. If needed, close and reopen the file
4. Or reload VS Code window (`Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Reload Window")

### Performance Issues

**If embeds slow down the editor:**
1. Reduce number of embeds per note (< 10 recommended)
2. Embed specific sections instead of full notes
3. Break up very large notes
4. Disable decorations temporarily if needed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Quick Embed Creation

1. Copy note name
2. Type `![[`
3. Paste note name
4. Type `]]`

Or use link autocomplete:
1. Type `![[`
2. Start typing note name
3. Select from autocomplete
4. Add `#section` if needed

### Navigate to Embedded Content

1. Hover over embed
2. Click "Open note ‚Üí" link
3. Note opens in editor
4. Optionally use split view for side-by-side

## Tips & Tricks

### Dynamic Content Aggregation

Create dashboard notes that pull in dynamic content:

```
Daily Dashboard
==================================================

![[today#Weather]]
![[calendar#Today's Meetings]]
![[tasks#High Priority]]
![[standup#Yesterday's Progress]]
```

Update source notes, and dashboard automatically reflects changes.

### Template Library

Build a library of reusable sections:

```
templates/
  meeting-templates.md
    # Standup Format
    # Retro Format
    # Planning Format
  email-templates.md
    # Introduction
    # Follow-up
    # Thank You
```

Embed any template on demand:
```
![[meeting-templates#Standup Format]]
```

### Documentation Assembly

Combine multiple source documents into a master doc:

```
Complete API Documentation
==================================================

![[api-intro#Overview]]
![[authentication#Getting Started]]
![[endpoints#REST API]]
![[examples#Common Use Cases]]
![[troubleshooting#FAQ]]
```

Maintain each section independently, but present as cohesive whole.

### Version History with Embeds

Reference historical versions:

```
Project Evolution
==================================================

## Phase 1
![[design-v1#Core Concept]]

## Phase 2
![[design-v2#Enhanced Features]]

## Current
![[design-v3#Final Implementation]]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Embeds

While embeds are static, you can create multiple template notes and choose which to embed:

```
# For new projects
![[onboarding-full]]

# For experienced team members
![[onboarding-quick-start]]
```

### Cross-Project References

If you have multiple workspaces:

```
# In Project A
![[../project-b/shared-standards#Coding Style]]
```

Note: Path-based embeds work with relative paths to other workspace folders.

### Embed Chains

Embeds can reference notes that contain embeds:

**Note A:**
```
![[note-b]]
```

**Note B:**
```
![[note-c#Section]]
```

Result: Note A shows content from Note C's section via Note B.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Keep chains short for performance.
